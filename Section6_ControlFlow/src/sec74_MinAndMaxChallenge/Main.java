/*
 * Use an endless loop which:
 *      -> prompts the user to enter a number or any character to quit.
 *      -> Validates if the user-entered data really is a number.
 *              You can choose either an integer or double validation method.
 *      -> If the user-entered data is not a number, quit the loop.
 *      -> Keep track of the minimum number entered.
 *      -> Keep track of the maximum number entered.
 *      -> if the user has previously entered a set of numbers  (or even just one),
 *              display the min and max number that the user entered.
