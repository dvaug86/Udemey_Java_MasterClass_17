I think i finally understand. if ourBedroom had a method that told us the direction of each wall direction then this wouldn't have looked like a ton of warnings. instead the results from running the program only shows us shows us methods from only the classes that don't have warnings.  In other words we aren't seeing warnings for lamp bed and bedroom because we are calling on those different classes when running the program.
